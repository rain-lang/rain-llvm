# rain-llvm

`rain-llvm` is a crate implementing `rain` to LLVM codegeneration, i.e. the conversion of `rain` IR stored in memory to `llvm` IR. We use [the experimental `inkwell` library](https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell) to generate LLVM: please reference the documentation (WIP) for a more in-depth overview of our code generation strategy.

Contributions, ideas and collaboration proposals are welcome: please make an issue or e-mail jad.ghalayini@mail.utoronto.ca.
